## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approach used in the function is to first check if the input string is null or empty. If it's not, it creates a HashMap to store each word and its count. Then, it splits the input string into words, and loops through each word. For each word, it checks if it's already in the HashMap. If it is, it returns the word. If not, it adds the word to the HashMap with a count of 1. If no repeated word is found, it returns null.
